Dev flavored ops
----------------

<aside class="notes">

  * Operations originally more service based
    * Someone wants X, you build X
    * roughly 1:1 (constant) relationship between work done and value received
  * CM changed this to be more product based
    * Someone wants X, you provide a way to build X
    * roughly 1:n (linear) relationship between work done and value received
  * By focusing on providing products instead of labor ops is resembling dev

<!--

With CM, operations moves from manually making changes to building the tools
and configurations that create the change. You're producing these artifacts that
you can use and reason about. This makes ops look less like traditional ops and
more like software development.

So we have this codebase composed of modules, cookbooks, playbooks, or whatnot.
What ideas can we reuse from software development and apply them to our code?
