Why VCS?
--------

<aside class="notes">

  * So why should we use VCS?
  * All of the obvious reasons
    * Code backup
    * History
    * Ability to undo errors
  * All of this standard stuff
  * These things miss the deeper benefits

<!--

VCS is where all things code are stored.

But VCS does a lot more than that. VCS should be the backbone of how you work.
It provides good ways to isolate changes, gives you rollback, allows you to
understand how things were changed.
