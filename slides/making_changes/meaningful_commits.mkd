    Add a defined type for nginx reverse proxies

    This enables the creation of a same-box nginx reverse proxy simply and
    easily. At its most basic, usage looks like

    ```puppet
    puppetlabs::appservices::nginx::ssl_proxy {'jira-web04-prod.puppetlabs.com': }
    ```

    which would create an nginx reverse proxy pointing at localhost:8000,
    listening on *:80 and *:443 for the servername
    `jira-web04-prod.puppetlabs.com` and forcing all traffic to HTTPS. As
    well, the reverse proxy enables a maintenance page on the same server
    which will be used when the real backend is unavailable.
