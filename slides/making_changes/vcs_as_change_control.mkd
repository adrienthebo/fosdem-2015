VCS as change control
---------------------

  * Break up work into logical commits
  * Change one thing at a time
  * Lots of small commits > fewer large commits
  * Meaningful commit messages

<!--

When writing a commit message, remember - the message isn't for you. You're the
one that wrote the code. The commit message is for everyone that follows you, so
that they can understand why you changed what you did without having to go
through your thought process.
