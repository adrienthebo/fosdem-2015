Testing - not just for devs!
------------------

<aside class="notes">

  * So we just described a testing framework
  * contributing to open source project
    * FEED ME TESTS
  * This is why people demand tests
    * You make a change
    * You want to make sure it works like you expect
    * Otherwise you have no idea if your change actually works

So what we just described was a testing framework. If you've ever submitted code
to an open source project you've probably heard something about "FEED ME TESTS"
or something like that. So this is why - if you make a change, you want to make
sure it works like you expect - otherwise, you have no idea if your change
worked, or didn't work and broke other things.
