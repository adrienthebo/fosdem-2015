Tests as a contract
-------------------

<aside class="notes">

  * Use tests to formally declare what customer wants
  * Hard format so that everyone can see what's expected
    * Here are the things we care about
    * RSpec output is a great way to demonstrate this
  * CYA
    * "If you cared about some service then why don't we need to test it?"
