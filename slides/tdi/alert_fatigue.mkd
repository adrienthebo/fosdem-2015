Alert fatigue
-------------

<aside class="notes">

  * So I came up with this great idea of testing
  * This has a pretty big risk - more tests risk spurious errors
  * Alarm fatigue
    * Exposed to a large number of frequent alarms
    * Desensitization over time
    * Longer response times or missing important alarms

  * Do this with caution
    * Some things are worth waking up at 3AM for
    * Many things are not
